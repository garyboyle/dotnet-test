# .Net Test Pre

A sample C# project to work out the development environment.

This project was created using the `dotnet new console` CLI command with the .NET Core 3.1 SDK.

Use the `dotnet run` command to run the project.

The `global.json` file determines what .NET SDK should be used.  This is similar in behaviour to a `.nvmrc` file.  More information here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/selection#the-sdk-uses-the-latest-installed-version
